        <p> Digital Chalkboard Tasks </p>
        <p>Add the new code to your own site.</p>
        <p class="h3">**First: make sure you've caught up from all previous tasks**</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a Bootstrap container so the body of the page behaves well. </li>
            <li>Create a navigation section. Your choice of style. </li>
            <li>This site has an h1 heading. Can you figure out how to display the text in a regular div on a screen that is narrower than 768px? </li>
            <li>Insert a new container and row as the home for four columns. </li>
            <li>Add some text to the columns. Cf. https://www.lipsum.com/. Make sure the columns stack on a phone. </li>
            <li>Create an external CSS file to use with this page. </li>
            <li>Add a subtle background color behind the columns. Think about the best CSS selector to use!! </li>
            <li>Check out the Bootstrap documentation to find ways to add some spacing between the columns when they stack up.
            </li>
            <li> Be ready to use Inspect mode to check the responsive mode of the site. </li>
            <li>Use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">@media query</a> to change the text spacing in the columns to justify. On screens wider than the large breakpoint, the text can be display in
                a normal format. On screens smaller than the large breakpoint, the text in the columns should display as justified.</li>
            <li>Use CSS to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial#Drop_cap">drop cap</a> for the first letter of each paragraph. HINT: you can use a pseudo-class called ::first-letter. You'll likely need the following CSS properties (tweak
                the values to your liking): color, font-family, font-size, line-height, padding-top, padding-right, padding-left. You'll also need float:left.</li>
            <li>Create a button on your page to launch a function.</li>
            <li>Create an external JavaScript file.</li>
            <li>Write a function to pop up a simple alert message.</li>
            <li>Use an onclick event to invoke your function.</li>
            <li>Add some images to your index.html page</li>
            <li>Use Bootstrap <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/images/#responsive-images">classes</a> to make sure the images behave.</li>
            <li>You can decide if you want an image to cover the entire width of the site or sit inside a column.</li>
            <li>You can decide if you want to use a Boostrap carousel or a simple div.</li>
            <li>Make sure the images adjust when the page resizes.</li>
            <li>Whatever approach you take, make sure the image is placed with intention.</li>
            <li>Add a bootstrap <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/sticky-footer/">footer</a>.</li>
            <li>Need a model for the footer? Check out <a href="https://rcc.uchicago.edu/">the RCC site</a>.</li>
            <li>We can take a moment to unpack the JQuery nav component from last class.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="h3">New Tasks for February 09 â€” Footer and Carousel</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a footer that behaves how you want it to behave.</li>
            <li>You may decide that the footer should always be present at the bottom of the screen and the body should scroll behind it (seems to be the current way of doing it).</li>
            <li>You may decide that the footer is only available when the user scrolls all the way to the bottom (this is sort of out of fashion).</li>
            <li>If you want to get fancy, try to create the footer in a separate html file add load it on your pages using JQuery.</li>
            <li>Consider hiding the footer on smaller screens.</li>
            <li>Let's see if we can all debug the Bootstrap carousel item.</li>
            <li>Some of you have reported that it isn't behaving very well.</li>
            <li>Are we finding that it loads blank pages?</li>
            <li>Can we control the height of the images well?</li>
        </ol>
